Initial State -> Session storage is cleared out
FIXED: When I sign up, i get redirected to /login 

I log in and get sent to onBoard/1, the Log out button doesn't appear

If I hit the Log Out button, i get redirected to the root
FIXED: SessionStorage data persists, specificially
     {navState, LinkedAccount, userID}

When I sign-up sometimes it sends me to onBoard/1 or /login


components/Form_Components/Register/Register.jsx is written to explicitly redirect
    us to onBoard/1. This happens from the RegisterActions.jsx file.

in App.js, onboard/1 is a protected route, wrapped with <PrivateRoute>
PrivateRoute checks to see if a token exists in sessionStorage, if so,
    redirects to /login

Possible Fixes:
1.  maybe redirect instead of hystory.push, much like the redirect from the app.js and logout button links

---
LogOut button doesn't appear when you first register and get redirected to onBoard/1/

Test:
Register button should redirect to /onBoard/1
